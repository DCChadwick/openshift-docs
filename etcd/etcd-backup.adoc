= Backing up and restoring etcd data
:context: etcd-backup

toc::[]

As the key-value store for {product-title}, etcd persists the state of all resource objects.

Back up the etcd data for your cluster regularly and store it in a secure location, ideally outside the {product-title} environment. Do not take an etcd backup before the first certificate rotation completes, which occurs 24 hours after installation, otherwise the backup will contain expired certificates. It is also recommended to take etcd backups during non-peak usage hours because the etcd snapshot has a high I/O cost.

Be sure to take an etcd backup before you update your cluster. Taking a backup before you update is important because when you restore your cluster, you must use an etcd backup that was taken from the same z-stream release. For example, an {product-title} 4.17.5 cluster must use an etcd backup that was taken from 4.17.5.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Back up your cluster's etcd data by performing a single invocation of the backup script on a control plane host. Do not take a backup for each control plane host.
====

After you have an etcd backup, you can xref:../etcd/etcd-backup.adoc#dr-scenario-2-restoring-cluster-state-about_etcd-backup[restore to a previous cluster state].

== Replacing an unhealthy etcd member

The process to replace a single unhealthy etcd member depends on whether the etcd member is unhealthy because the machine is not running or the node is not ready, or because the etcd pod is crashlooping.

[NOTE]
====
If you have lost the majority of your control plane hosts, follow the disaster recovery procedure to  xref:../etcd/etcd-backup.adoc#dr-scenario-2-restoring-cluster-state-about_etcd-backup[restore to a previous cluster state] instead of this procedure.

If the control plane certificates are not valid on the member being replaced, then you must follow the procedure to xref:../etcd/etcd-backup.adoc#dr-scenario-3-recovering-expired-certs_etcd-backup[recover from expired control plane certificates] instead of this procedure.

If a control plane node is lost and a new one is created, the etcd cluster Operator handles generating the new TLS certificates and adding the node as an etcd member.

== Disaster recovery

The disaster recovery documentation provides information for administrators on how to recover from several disaster situations that might occur with their {product-title} cluster. As an administrator, you might need to follow one or more of the following procedures to return your cluster to a working state.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Disaster recovery requires you to have at least one healthy control plane host.
====

xref:../etcd/etcd-backup.adoc#dr-restoring-etcd-quorum-ha_etcd-backup[Restoring etcd quorum for high availability clusters]:: This solution handles situations where you have lost the majority of your control plane hosts, leading to etcd quorum loss and the cluster going offline. This solution does not require an etcd backup.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you have a majority of your control plane nodes still available and have an etcd quorum, xref:../etcd/etcd-backup.adoc#replace-unhealthy-etcd-member_etcd-backup[replace a single unhealthy etcd member].
====

xref:../etcd/etcd-backup.adoc#dr-scenario-2-restoring-cluster-state-about_etcd-backup[Restoring to a previous cluster state]:: This solution handles situations where you want to restore your cluster to a previous state, for example, if an administrator deletes something critical. If you have taken an etcd backup, you can restore your cluster to a previous state.
+
If applicable, you might also need to xref:../etcd/etcd-backup.adoc#dr-scenario-3-recovering-expired-certs_etcd-backup[recover from expired control plane certificates].
+
[WARNING]
====
Restoring to a previous cluster state is a destructive and destablizing action to take on a running cluster. This procedure should only be used as a last resort.

Before performing a restore, see xref:../etcd/etcd-backup.adoc#dr-scenario-2-restoring-cluster-state-about_etcd-backup[Restoring a cluster state] for more information on the impact to the cluster.
====

xref:../etcd/etcd-backup.adoc#dr-scenario-3-recovering-expired-certs_etcd-backup[Recovering from expired control plane certificates]:: This solution handles situations where your control plane certificates have expired. For example, if you shut down your cluster before the first certificate rotation, which occurs 24 hours after installation, your certificates will not be rotated and will expire. You can follow this procedure to recover from expired control plane certificates.
