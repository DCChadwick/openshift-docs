{product-title-first} provides developers and IT organizations with small-form-factor and edge computing delivered as an application that customers can deploy on top of their managed {op-system-base-full} devices at the edge. Built on {OCP} and Kubernetes, {microshift-short} provides an efficient way to operate single-node clusters in low-resource edge environments.

{microshift-short} is designed to make control plane restarts economical and be lifecycle-managed as a single unit by the operating system. Updates, roll-backs, and configuration changes consist of simply staging another version in parallel and then - without relying on a network - flipping to and from that version and restarting.

== New features and enhancements

This release adds improvements related to the following components and concepts.

//L3 major categories with features in each as L4s
//[id="microshift-4-20-rhel_{context}"]
//=== {op-system-base-full}

//[id="microshift-4-20-rhel-image-mode_{context}"]
//==== {op-system-base} image mode delta updates available
//placeholder for delta updates

//4.20 is an EUS release, so two minor version updates are supported

[id="microshift-4-20-updating_{context}"]
=== Updating

Updating two minor EUS versions in a single step is supported in {product-version}. Updates for both single-version minor releases and patch releases are also supported. See xref:../microshift_updating/microshift-update-options.adoc#microshift-update-options[Update options with {product-title} and {op-system-bundle}] for details.

//TODO add new features and enhancements as needed, follow doc TOC titles as L3s, then add L4 headings for each feature

=== Configuring {microshift-short}

[id="microshift-4-20-ingress-controller-three-config_{context}"]
==== Inspect ingress for your use case with additional logging parameters

With this release, you can configure custom error code pages and logging parameters in the router, and you can capture HTTP headers and cookies in the ingress controller access logs. For more information, see xref:../microshift_configuring/microshift-ingress-controller.adoc#microshift-ingress-controller[Using ingress control for a {microshift-short} cluster].

=== Running applications

[id="microshift-4-20-install-cert-manager_{context}"]
==== Install MicroShift certificate manager

With this release, {microshift-short} users can securely manage certificates for their components by using the cert-manager Operator. This enhancement automates the issuance and renewal of SSL/TLS certificates, enhancing data protection and ensuring regulatory compliance. It enables standardized certificate management, enhances node security, and results in more secure and standardized communication within and between user services. For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.19/html/security_and_compliance/cert-manager-operator-for-red-hat-openshift[cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift].

[id="microshift-4-20-Generic-Device-Plugin_{context}"]
=== Generic Device Plugin feature

* The Generic Device Plugin (GDP) is a Kubernetes device plugin that enables applications running in pods to access host devices such as serial ports, cameras, and sound cards securely. This Technology Preview capability is especially important for edge and IoT environments where direct hardware interaction is a common requirement. The GDP integrates with the kubelet to advertise available devices to the cluster and facilitate their allocation to pods without requiring elevated privileges within the container itself.

//[id="microshift-4-20-ai_{context}"]
//=== Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift AI with {microshift-short}

//[id="microshift-4-20-rhoai-ga_{context}"]
//==== Serve your trained models on edge deployments

//With this release, a streamlined version of {rhoai-full} {rhoai} is Generally Available. {rhoai} can be used to serve artificial intelligence or machine learning (AI/ML) models on {microshift-short}. Develop and train your AI models in the data center or cloud, then deploy them to the edge where these models can make decisions without a human user. For more information, see xref:../microshift_ai/microshift-rhoai.adoc#microshift-rhoai[Using Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift AI with {microshift-short}].

//[id="microshift-4-20-deprecated-and-removed-features_{context}"]
//== Deprecated and removed features

//Some features available in previous releases have been deprecated or removed. Deprecated functionality is still included in and continues to be supported, but will be removed in a future release. Deprecated features and functionality are not recommended for new deployments.

//[id="microshift-4-20-x-deprecated_{context}"]
//=== placeholder

//NOTE: Do NOT repeat bug fixes already noted in previous version z-streams
//[id="microshift-4-20-bug-fixes_{context}"]
//== Bug fixes

//*

[id="microshift-4-20-known-issues_{context}"]
== Known issues

* The maximum transmission unit (MTU) value in {microshift-short} OVN-K overlay networking must be 100 bytes smaller than the MTU value of the base network. {microshift-short} automatically configures the value using the MTU value of the default gateway of the host. If the auto-configuration does not work correctly, the MTU value must be configured manually. For more information, see xref:../microshift_networking/microshift-cni.adoc#microshift-network-topology_microshift-about-ovn-k-plugin[Network topology].
