= What are load balancers?

Load balancers are devices that perform load balancing. They act as intermediaries between clients and servers to manage and direct traffic based on predefined rules. {product-title} supports the following types of load balancers:

* Classic Load Balancer (CLB)
* Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)
* Network Load Balancer (NLB)
* Application Load Balancer (ALB)

ELB is the default load-balancer type for AWS routers. CLB is the default for self-managed environments. NLB is the default for Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA).

[IMPORTANT]
====
You should use ALB directly in front of an application but not in front of the router. Using ALBs requires the AWS Load Balancer Operator add-on. This operator is not supported for all AWS regions or for all {product-title-short} profiles.
