= NC-SI hardware requirements for bare metal

To deploy {product-title} 4.19 and later with a Network Controller Sideband Interface (NC-SI) on bare metal, you must use hardware with baseboard management controllers (BMCs) and network interface cards (NICs) that support NC-SI. NC-SI enables the BMC to share a system NIC with the host, requiring the `DisablePowerOff` feature to prevent loss of BMC connectivity during power-offs.

[NOTE]
====
Verify NC-SI support with vendor documentation, because compatibility depends on BMC, NIC, and firmware configurations. NC-SI NICs require a compatible BMC to enable shared NIC functionality.
