= Networking in Kubernetes and OpenShift 

Networking in Kubernetes and Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform ensures seamless communication between various components within the cluster and between external clients and the cluster. Both platforms rely on several core concepts and components:
* Pod-to-Pod Communications
* Services
* DNS
* Ingress Controllers 
* Network Policies
* Load Balancing

For more information these concepts and components, see Networking concepts and components <insert link>. 

In OpenShift (and Kubernetes in general), services are used to expose pods internally and externally, allowing for seamless communication within the cluster and with external clients. Using Network Policies to control and secure traffic flow within the cluster. Utilizing load balancers to distribute traffic and maintain service availability.
