= Define the default load balancer type

When installing the cluster, you can specify the type of load balancer that you want to use. This process is global. The type of load balancer you choose at installation will be applied to the entire cluster if no specific type is defined elsewhere.

[NOTE]
====
This example shows how to define the default load-balancer type for a cluster deployed on AWS. This procedure can be followed for other platforms.
