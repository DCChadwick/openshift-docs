= About adding devices to a volume group

The `deviceSelector` field in the `LVMCluster` custom resource (CR) contains the configuration to specify the paths to the devices that you want to add to the LVM volume group.

You can specify the device paths in the `deviceSelector.paths` field, the `deviceSelector.optionalPaths` field, or both. If you do not specify the device paths in both the `deviceSelector.paths` field and the `deviceSelector.optionalPaths` field, {lvms} adds the unused devices to the LVM volume group. 

[WARNING]
====
It is recommended to avoid referencing disks using symbolic naming, such as `/dev/sdX`, as these names may change across reboots within RHCOS. Instead, you must use stable naming schemes, such as `/dev/disk/by-path/` or `/dev/disk/by-id/`, to ensure consistent disk identification.

With this change, you might need to adjust existing automation workflows in the cases where monitoring collects information about the install device for each node.

For more information, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/managing_file_systems/assembly_overview-of-persistent-naming-attributes_managing-file-systems[{op-system-base} documentation].
====

If you do not add the `deviceSelector` field in the `LVMCluster` CR, {lvms} automatically adds the new devices when the devices are available.

{lvms} adds the devices to the LVM volume group only if the device path exists.

[IMPORTANT]
====
After a device is added to the LVM volume group, it cannot be removed.
