= {microshift-short} certificate manager functions

[role="_abstract"]
With {microshift-short} certificate manager, you can complete the following tasks:

* Automates certificate management: cert-manager creates or updates certificates and detects Kubernetes resources that are annotated with `cert-manager.io/kind`.
* Supports multiple CAs: provides flexibility to select one that fits the security and operational needs.
* Simplifies ingress certificates: cert-manager handles certificates for an ingress controller, which simplifies the configuration and management of secure communication channels.
* Enhances security: certificate management is automated and the risk of error is reduced. Certificates are current and valid, which contribute to a secure environment.
