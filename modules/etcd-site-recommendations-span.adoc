= Site recommendations

Assuming each site gets one control plane member, you theoretically define three sites, which is what Red Hat recommends. This allows for one data center to go into an inactive state and the cluster still maintains quorum and operational consistency.

When this assumption is not met, attention should be given to the desired and actual fault tolerance state of the cluster, as it will often outline or dictate the operational capabilities (uptime and stability) of the deployment.
