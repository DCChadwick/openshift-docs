= Migrating a VM to a specific node

You can migrate a running virtual machine (VM) to a specific subset of nodes by using the `addedNodeSelector` field on the `VirtualMachineInstanceMigration` object. This field lets you apply additional node selection rules for a *one-time* migration attempt, without affecting the VM configuration or future migrations.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.
* The VM you want to migrate is running.
* You have identified the labels of the target nodes. Multiple labels can be specified and are combined with logical `AND`.
* The `oc` CLI tool is installed.

.Procedure

. Create a migration manifest YAML file. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1
kind: VirtualMachineInstanceMigration
metadata:
  name: migration-job
spec:
  vmiName: vmi-fedora
  addedNodeSelector:
    accelerator: gpu-enabled23
    kubernetes.io/hostname: "ip-172-28-114-199.example"
----
+

where:

`vmiName`:: Specifies the name of the running VM (for example, `vmi-fedora`).
`addedNodeSelector`:: Specifies additional constraints for selecting the target node.

. Apply the manifest to the cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <file_name>.yaml
----
+
If no nodes satisfy the constraints, the migration is declared a failure after a timeout. The VM remains unaffected.
