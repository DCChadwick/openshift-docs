[id="virt-launching-ibm-secure-execution-vm-ibm-z_{context}"]
= Launching an {ibm-title} Secure Execution VM on {ibm-z-title} and {ibm-linuxone-title}

Before launching an {ibm-name} Secure Execution VM on {ibm-z-name} and {ibm-linuxone-name}, you must add the `launchSecurity` parameter to the VM manifest. Otherwise, the VM does not boot correctly because it does not have access to the devices.

.Procedure

* Apply the following `VirtualMachine` manifest to the cluster:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1
kind: VirtualMachine
metadata:
  labels:
    kubevirt.io/vm: f41-se
  name: f41-se
spec:
  runStrategy: Always
  template:

      volumes:
        - name: rootfs
          dataVolume:
            name: f41-se
----
+
To launch {ibm-name} Secure Execution VMs, you must include the following YAML in the manifest:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
   domain:
     launchSecurity: {}
----
+
The rest of the VM manifest is variable depending on your setup.
+
[NOTE]
====
Because the memory of the VM is protected, {ibm-name} Secure Execution VMs are not live migratable. The VMs can only be migrated offline.
