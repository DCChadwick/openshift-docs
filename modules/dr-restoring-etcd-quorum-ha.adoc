= Restoring etcd quorum for high availability clusters

You can use the `quorum-restore.sh` script to instantly bring back a new single-member etcd cluster based on its local data directory and mark all other members as invalid by retiring the previous cluster identifier. No prior backup is required to restore the control plane from.

[WARNING]
====
You might experience data loss if the host that runs the restoration does not have all data replicated to it.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have SSH access to the node used to restore quorum.

.Procedure

. Select a control plane host to use as the recovery host. You run the restore operation on this host.

. Using SSH,  connect to the chosen recovery node and run the following command to restore etcd quorum:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ sudo -E /usr/local/bin/quorum-restore.sh
----

. Exit the SSH session.

. Wait until the control plane recovers by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm wait-for-stable-cluster
----

.Troubleshooting

If you see no progress rolling out the etcd static pods, you can force redeployment from the `cluster-etcd-operator` pod by running the following command:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch etcd cluster -p='{"spec": {"forceRedeploymentReason": "recovery-'"$(date --rfc-3339=ns )"'"}}' --type=merge
----
