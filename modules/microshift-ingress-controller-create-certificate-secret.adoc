= Creating a secret for the ingress controller certificate

* The `certificateSecret` parameter value is a reference to a secret that contains the default certificate that is served by the ingress controller. When routes do not specify their own certificate, the `certificateSecret` parameter is used. The certificate is valid for the ingress controller domain and subdomains, and the generated certificate's CA is automatically integrated with the cluster's truststore.

The in-use certificate, whether generated or user-specified, is automatically integrated with the {microshift-short} built-in OAuth server.

.Prerequisites

* The private key must be unencrypted. If your key is encrypted, decrypt it before importing it into {microshift-short}.
* The certificate must include the `subjectAltName` extension showing `*.apps.<clustername>.<domain>`.

.Procedure

. Create a secret that contains the wildcard certificate chain and key:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create secret tls <secret> <1>
     --cert=</path/to/cert.crt> <2>
     --key=</path/to/cert.key> <3>
     -n openshift-ingress
----
<1> `<secret>` is the name of the secret that contains the certificate chain and private key.
<2> `</path/to/cert.crt>` is the path to the certificate chain on your local file system.
<3> `</path/to/cert.key>` is the path to the private key associated with this certificate.
+
. Update the `certificateSecret` parameter value in the {microshift-short} YAML configuration file with the newly created secret.
+
. Restart the {microshift-short} service.
