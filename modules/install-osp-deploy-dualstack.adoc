= Deploying the dual-stack cluster

For dual-stack networking in {product-title} clusters, you can configure IPv4 and IPv6 address endpoints for cluster nodes. 

.Prerequisites

* You enabled Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) on the subnets.

.Procedure

. Create a network with IPv4 and IPv6 subnets. The available address modes for `ipv6-ra-mode` and `ipv6-address-mode` fields are: `stateful`, `stateless` and `slaac`.
+
[NOTE]
====
The dual-stack network MTU must accommodate both the minimum MTU for IPv6, which is `1280`, and the OVN-Kubernetes encapsulation overhead, which is `100`.
====

. Create the API and Ingress VIPs ports.

. Add the IPv6 subnet to the router to enable router advertisements. If you are using a provider network, you can enable router advertisements by adding the network as an external gateway, which also enables external connectivity.

. For an IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack cluster where you set IPv4 as the primary endpoint for your cluster nodes, edit the `install-config.yaml` file like the following example:

----
<1> Dual-stack clusters are supported only with the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` value.
<2> You must specify an IP address range in the `cidr` field for both IPv4 and IPv6 address families.
<3> Specify the virtual IP (VIP) address endpoints for the Ingress VIP services to provide an interface to the cluster.
<4> Specify the virtual IP (VIP) address endpoints for the API VIP services to provide an interface to the cluster.
<5> Specify the dual-stack network details that are used by all the nodes across the cluster.
<6> The Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) of any subnet specified in this field must match the CIDRs listed on `networks.machineNetwork`.
<7> You can specify a value for `name`, `id`, or both.

[NOTE]
====
The `ip=dhcp,dhcp6` kernel argument, which is set on all of the nodes, results in a single Network Manager connection profile that is activated on multiple interfaces simultaneously.
Because of this behavior, any additional network has the same connection enforced with an identical UUID. If you need an interface-specific configuration, create a new connection profile for that interface so that the default connection is no longer enforced on it.
