= Preparation for SiteConfig CRs to ClusterInstance CRs migration

To prepare for the migration from `SiteConfig` CRs to `ClusterInstance` CRs, you must complete the following steps:

* Delete the ArgoCD application in the target cluster.

* Prepare the git repository by creating a directory for migrated clusters with the `ClusterInstance` CRs and associated resources.

* Optionally, use the `siteconfig-converter` tool to convert existing `SiteConfig` CRs to `ClusterInstance` CRs at scale.
