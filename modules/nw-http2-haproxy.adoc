= Enabling and Disabling HTTP/2 Ingress Connectivity

You can enable or disable transparent end-to-end HTTP/2 connectivity in HAProxy. This allows application owners to make use of HTTP/2 protocol capabilities, including single connection, header compression, binary streams, and more.

You can enable or disable HTTP/2 connectivity for an individual Ingress Controller or for the entire cluster.

[NOTE]
====
If you enable or disable HTTP/2 connectivity for an individual Ingress Controller and for the entire cluster, the HTTP/2 configuration for the Ingress Controller takes precedence over the HTTP/2 configuration for the cluster. 
====

To enable the use of HTTP/2 for a connection from the client to an HAProxy instance, a route must specify a custom certificate. A route that uses the default certificate cannot use HTTP/2. This restriction is necessary to avoid problems from connection coalescing, where the client re-uses a connection for different routes that use the same certificate.

Consider the following use cases for an HTTP/2 connection for each route type: 

* For a re-encrypt route, the connection from HAProxy to the application pod can use HTTP/2 if the application supports using Application-Level Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) to negotiate HTTP/2 with HAProxy. You cannot use HTTP/2 with a re-encrypt route unless the Ingress Controller has HTTP/2 enabled.
* For a passthrough route, the connection can use HTTP/2 if the application supports using ALPN to negotiate HTTP/2 with the client. You can use HTTP/2 with a passthrough route if the Ingress Controller has HTTP/2 enabled or disabled.
* For an edge-terminated secure route, the connection uses HTTP/2 if the service specifies only `appProtocol: kubernetes.io/h2c`. You can use HTTP/2 with an edge-terminated secure route if the Ingress Controller has HTTP/2 enabled or disabled.
* For an insecure route, the connection uses HTTP/2 if the service specifies only `appProtocol: kubernetes.io/h2c`. You can use HTTP/2 with an insecure route if the Ingress Controller has HTTP/2 enabled or disabled.

[IMPORTANT]
====
For non-passthrough routes, the Ingress Controller negotiates its connection to the application independently of the connection from the client. This means a client may connect to the Ingress Controller and negotiate HTTP/1.1, and the Ingress Controller may then connect to the application, negotiate HTTP/2, and forward the request from the client HTTP/1.1 connection using the HTTP/2 connection to the application. This poses a problem if the client subsequently tries to upgrade its connection from HTTP/1.1 to the WebSocket protocol, because the Ingress Controller cannot forward WebSocket to HTTP/2 and cannot upgrade its HTTP/2 connection to WebSocket. Consequently, if you have an application that is intended to accept WebSocket connections, it must not allow negotiating the HTTP/2 protocol or else clients will fail to upgrade to the WebSocket protocol.
