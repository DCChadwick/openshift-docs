= Volume populators overview

In {product-title} versions 4.12 through 4.19, the `dataSource` field in a persistent volume claim (PVC) spec provides volume populator capability. However, it is limited to using only PVCs and snapshots as the data source for populating volumes. 

Starting with {product-title} version 4.20, the `dataSourceRef` field is used instead. With the `dataSourceRef` field, you can use any appropriate custom resource (CR) as the data source to prepopulate a new volume.

[NOTE]
====
Volume populator functionality using the `dataSource` field is likely to be deprecated in future versions. If you have created any volume populators using this field, consider re-creating your volume populators to use the `dataSourceRef` field to avoid future issues.
====

Volume population is enabled by default and {product-title} includes the installed `volume-data-source-validator` controller. However, {product-title} does not ship with any volume populators.
