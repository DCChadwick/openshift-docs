= Workload placement considerations

With multisite clusters, administrators and developers must take special considerations into account to ensure that critical workloads are scheduled or placed based on the proper hardware or hosts within the topology of the cluster. This ensures that the applications and services are Highly Available and Fault Tolerant based on the topology of the cluster's deployment.

Without considering this, it is possible for {product-title} to schedule workloads on hosts within the cluster so that a Single Point of Failure (SPoF) is created for {product-title} infrastructure services and other application services if there is a data center outage.
