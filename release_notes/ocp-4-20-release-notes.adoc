== About this release

// TODO: Update with the relevant information closer to release.
{product-title} (link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-202X:XXXX[RHSA-202X:XXXXX]) is now available. This release uses link:https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.33.md[Kubernetes 1.33] with CRI-O runtime. New features, changes, and known issues that pertain to {product-title} {product-version} are included in this topic.

{product-title} {product-version} clusters are available at https://console.redhat.com/openshift. From the {hybrid-console}, you can deploy {product-title} clusters to either on-premises or cloud environments.

You must use {op-system} machines for the control plane and for the compute machines.
//Removed the note per https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GRPA-3517
//Removed paragraph about the RHEL package because mode workers are removed from 4.19, per Scott Dodson
//Even-numbered release lifecycle verbiage (Comment in for even-numbered releases)

Starting from {product-title} 4.14, the Extended Update Support (EUS) phase for even-numbered releases increases the total available lifecycle to 24 months on all supported architectures, including `x86_64`, 64-bit ARM (`aarch64`), {ibm-power-name} (`ppc64le`), and {ibm-z-name} (`s390x`) architectures. Beyond this, Red{nbsp}Hat also offers a 12-month additional EUS add-on, denoted as _Additional EUS Term 2_, that extends the total available lifecycle from 24 months to 36 months. The Additional EUS Term 2 is available on all architecture variants of {product-title}. For more information about support for all versions, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[Red Hat {product-title} Life Cycle Policy].

//Odd-numbered release lifecycle verbiage (Comment in for odd-numbered releases)
////
The support lifecycle for odd-numbered releases, such as {product-title} {product-version}, on all supported architectures, including `x86_64`, 64-bit ARM (`aarch64`), {ibm-power-name} (`ppc64le`), and {ibm-z-name} (`s390x`) architectures is 18 months. For more information about support for all versions, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[Red Hat {product-title} Life Cycle Policy].

Commencing with the {product-title} 4.14 release, Red{nbsp}Hat is simplifying the administration and management of Red{nbsp}Hat shipped cluster Operators with the introduction of three new life cycle classifications; Platform Aligned, Platform Agnostic, and Rolling Stream. These life cycle classifications provide additional ease and transparency for cluster administrators to understand the life cycle policies of each Operator and form cluster maintenance and upgrade plans with predictable support boundaries. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/webassets/avalon/j/includes/session/scribe/?redirectTo=https%3A%2F%2Faccess.redhat.com%2Fsupport%2Fpolicy%2Fupdates%2Fopenshift_operators[OpenShift Operator Life Cycles].

// Added in 4.14. Language came directly from Kirsten Newcomer.
{product-title} is designed for FIPS. When running {op-system-base-full} or {op-system-first} booted in FIPS mode, {product-title} core components use the {op-system-base} cryptographic libraries that have been submitted to NIST for FIPS 140-2/140-3 Validation on only the `x86_64`, `ppc64le`, and `s390x` architectures.

For more information about the NIST validation program, see link:https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/validated-modules[Cryptographic Module Validation Program]. For the latest NIST status for the individual versions of {op-system-base} cryptographic libraries that have been submitted for validation, see link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/2918071#fips-140-2-and-fips-140-3-2[Compliance Activities and Government Standards].

For more information, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openshift[Red Hat {product-title} Life Cycle Policy].

[id="ocp-4-20-new-features-and-enhancements_{context}"]
== New features and enhancements

This release adds improvements related to the following components and concepts:

[id="ocp-release-notes-auth_{context}"]
=== Authentication and authorization

[id="ocp-release-notes-auth-direct_{context}"]
==== Enabling direct authentication with an external OIDC identity provider (Technology Preview)

With this release, you can enable direct integration with an external OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider to issue tokens for authentication. This bypasses the built-in OAuth server and uses the external identity provider directly.

By integrating directly with an external OIDC provider, you can leverage the advanced capabilities of your preferred OIDC provider instead of being limited by the capabilities of the built-in OAuth server. Your organization can manage users and groups from a single interface, while also streamlining authentication across multiple clusters and in hybrid environments. You can also integrate with existing tools and solutions.

Direct authentication is available as a Technology Preview feature.

For more information, see xref:../authentication/external-auth.adoc#external-auth[Enabling direct authentication with an external OIDC identity provider].

[id="ocp-4-20-auth-ServiceAccountTokenNodeBinding_{context}"]
==== Enable ServiceAccountTokenNodeBinding Kubernetes feature by default

In {product-title} {product-version}, the `ServiceAccountTokenNodeBinding` feature is now enabled by default, aligning with upstream Kubernetes behavior. This feature allows service account tokens to be bound directly to node objects in addition to the existing binding options. Benefits of this change include enhanced security through automatic token invalidation when bound nodes are deleted and better protection against token replay attacks across different nodes.

[id="ocp-release-notes-documentation_{context}"]
=== Documentation

[id="ocp-release-notes-documentation-etcd_{context}"]
==== Consolidated etcd documentation

This release includes an _etcd_ section, which consolidates all of the existing documentation about etcd for {product-title}. For more information, see xref:../etcd/etcd-overview.adoc#etc-overview[Overview of etcd].

[id="ocp-release-notes-documentation-tutorials_{context}"]
==== Tutorials guide

{product-title} 4.20 now includes a _Tutorials_ guide, which takes the place of the _Getting started_ guide in previous releases. The existing tutorials were refreshed and the guide now focuses solely on hands-on tutorial content. It also provides a jumping off point to other recommended hands-on learning resources for {product-title} across Red{nbsp}Hat.

For more information, see xref:../tutorials/index.adoc#tutorials-overview[Tutorials].

[id="ocp-release-notes-edge-computing_{context}"]
=== Edge computing

[id="ocp-release-edge-computing_pg-ztp-rhacm_{context}"]
==== Using {rh-rhacm} PolicyGenerator resources to manage {ztp} cluster policies (General Availability)

You can now use `PolicyGenerator` resources and {rh-rhacm-first} to deploy polices for managed clusters with {ztp}.
The `PolicyGenerator` API is part of the link:https://open-cluster-management.io/[Open Cluster Management] standard and provides a generic way of patching resources, which is not possible with the `PolicyGenTemplate` API.
Using `PolicyGenTemplate` resources to manage and deploy polices will be deprecated in an upcoming {product-title} release.

For more information, see xref:../edge_computing/policygenerator_for_ztp/ztp-configuring-managed-clusters-policygenerator.adoc#ztp-configuring-managed-clusters-policygenerator[Configuring managed cluster policies by using PolicyGenerator resources].

[id="ocp-release-edge-computing-arbiter-node_{context}"]
==== Configuring a local arbiter node

You can configure an {product-title} cluster with two control plane nodes and one local arbiter node so to retain high availability (HA) while reducing infrastructure costs for your cluster. This configuration is only supported for bare-metal installations.

A local arbiter node is a lower-cost, co-located machine that participates in control plane quorum decisions. Unlike a standard control plane node, the arbiter node does not run the full set of control plane services. You can use this configuration to maintain HA in your cluster with only two fully provisioned control plane nodes instead of three.

To enable this feature, you must define the arbiter machine pool in the `install-config.yaml` file and enable the `TechPreviewNoUpgrade` feature set. For more information, see xref:../installing/installing_bare_metal/ipi/ipi-install-installation-workflow.adoc#ipi-install-config-local-arbiter-node_ipi-install-installation-workflow[Configuring a local arbiter node].

[id="ocp-release-edge-computing-coordinating-reboots_{context}"]
==== Coordinating reboots for configuration changes

This release adds reboot policies to ZTP reference that can be applied by {cgu-operator-full} (TALM) to coordinate reboots across a fleet of spoke clusters when configuration changes require a reboot, such as deferred tuning changes. {cgu-operator} reboots all nodes in the targeted `MachineConfigPool` object on the selected clusters when the reboot policy is applied.

Instead of rebooting nodes after each individual change, you can apply all configuration updates through policies and then trigger a single, coordinated reboot.

For more information, see xref:../edge_computing/policygenerator_for_ztp/ztp-configuring-managed-clusters-policygenerator.adoc#ztp-coordinating-reboots-for-config-changes_ztp-configuring-managed-clusters-policygenerator[Coordinating reboots for configuration changes].

[id="ocp-release-notes-extensions_{context}"]
=== Extensions ({olmv1})

[id="ocp-release-notes-olmv1-preflight-permissions-check_{context}"]
==== Preflight permissions check for cluster extensions (Technology Preview)

With this release, the Operator Controller performs a dry run of the installation process when you try to install an extension. This dry run verifies that the specified service account has the required role-based access control (RBAC) rules for the roles and bindings defined by the bundle.

If the service account is missing any required RBAC rules, the preflight check fails before the actual installation proceeds and generates a report.

For more information, see xref:../extensions/ce/managing-ce.adoc#olmv1-troubleshooting-rbac-errors-with-preflight-check_managing-ce[Preflight permissions check for cluster extensions (Technology Preview)]

[id="ocp-release-notes-olmv1-deploying-a-cluster-extension-to-a-specific-namespace_{context}"]
==== Deploying a cluster extension in a specific namespace (Technology Preview)

With this release, you can deploy an extension in a specific namespace by using the `OwnNamespace` or `SingleNamespace` install modes as a Technology Preview feature for `registry+v1` Operator bundles.

For more information, see xref:../extensions/ce/managing-ce.adoc#olmv1-deploying-a-ce-in-a-specific-namespace_managing-ce[Deploying a cluster extension in a specific namespace (Technology Preview)]

[id="ocp-release-notes-hcp_{context}"]
=== Hosted control planes

Because {hcp} releases asynchronously from {product-title}, it has its own release notes. For more information, see xref:../hosted_control_planes/hosted-control-planes-release-notes.adoc#hosted-control-planes-release-notes[{hcp-capital} release notes].

[id="ocp-release-notes-hcp-openstack-tp_{context}"]
==== Hosted control planes on {rh-openstack-first} 17.1 (Technology Preview)

{hcp-capital} on {rh-openstack} 17.1 are now supported as a Technology Preview.

For more information, see xref:../hosted_control_planes/hcp-deploy/hcp-deploy-openstack.adoc#hosted-clusters-openstack-prerequisites_hcp-deploy-openstack[Deploying hosted control planes on OpenStack].

[id="ocp-release-notes-ibm-power_{context}"]
=== {ibm-power-title}

The {ibm-power-name} release on {product-title} {product-version} adds improvements and new capabilities to {product-title} components.

This release introduces support for the following features on {ibm-power-title}:

* Expand Compliance Operator support with profiles for Defense Information Systems Agency Security Technical Implementation Guide (DISA STIG)

[id="ocp-release-notes-ibm-z_{context}"]
=== {ibm-z-title} and {ibm-linuxone-title}

The {ibm-z-name} and {ibm-linuxone-name} release on {product-title} {product-version} adds improvements and new capabilities to {product-title} components.

This release introduces support for the following features on {ibm-z-name} and {ibm-linuxone-name}:

* Support for {ibm-name} z17 and {ibm-linuxone-name} 5
* Boot volume Linux Unified Key Setup (LUKS) encryption via {ibm-name} Crypto Express (CEX)
