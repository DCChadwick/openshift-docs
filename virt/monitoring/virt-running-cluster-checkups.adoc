toc::[]

{VirtProductName} includes the following predefined checkups that can be used for cluster maintenance and troubleshooting:

* Latency checkup, which verifies network connectivity and measures latency between two virtual machines (VMs) that are attached to a secondary network interface.
+
[IMPORTANT]
=====
Before you run a latency checkup, you must first xref:../../virt/vm_networking/virt-connecting-vm-to-linux-bridge.adoc#virt-connecting-vm-to-linux-bridge[create a bridge interface] on the cluster nodes to connect the VM's secondary interface to any interface on the node. If you do not create a bridge interface, the VMs do not start and the job fails.
=====

* Storage checkup, which verifies if the cluster storage is optimally configured for {VirtProductName}.
