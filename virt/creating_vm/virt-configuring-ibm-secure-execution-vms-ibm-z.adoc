= Configuring {ibm-title} Secure Execution virtual machines on {ibm-z-title} and {ibm-linuxone-title}

toc::[]

You can configure {ibm-name} Secure Execution virtual machines (VMs) on {ibm-z-name} and {ibm-linuxone-name}.

{ibm-name} Secure Execution for Linux is a s390x security technology that is introduced with {ibm-name} z15 and {ibm-linuxone-name} III. It protects data of workloads that run in a KVM guest from being inspected or modified by the server environment.

In particular, no hardware administrator, no KVM code, and no KVM administrator can access the data in a guest that was started as an IBM Secure Execution guest.
