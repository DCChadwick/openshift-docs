//CNV-38746
* When you update from {product-title} 4.12 to a newer minor version, VMs that use the `cnv-bridge` Container Network Interface (CNI) fail to live migrate. (link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/7069807[])
** As a workaround, change the `spec.config.type` field in your `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` manifest from `cnv-bridge` to `bridge` before performing the update.
