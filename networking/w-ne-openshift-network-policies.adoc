= Network Policies

Network policies define rules for how pods are allowed to communicate with each other and with other network endpoints. This helps secure the cluster by controlling traffic flow. These policies are implemented at the network level, ensuring that only allowed traffic can flow between pods. By leveraging these mechanisms, OpenShift ensures reliable and secure communication within the cluster, enabling efficient operation of applications and services.
