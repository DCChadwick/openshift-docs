= What is an external client?

An external client refers to any entity outside of the cluster that interacts with the services and applications running within the cluster. This can include end users, external services, and external devices. End users are people who access a web application hosted in the cluster through their browsers or mobile devices. External services are other software systems or applications that interact with the services in the cluster, often through APIs. External devices are any hardware outside the cluster network that needs to communicate with the cluster services, like IoT devices.

External clients typically access the cluster services through well-defined interfaces and endpoints, often managed by Ingress Controllers and Load Balancers to ensure secure by and efficient traffic routing.
