= What is ingress?

Ingress is a Kubernetes resource that provides more advanced routing capabilities, including load balancing, SSL termination, and name-based virtual hosting. Here are some key points about Ingress:

HTTP/HTTPS Routing::
Ingress allows you to define rules for routing HTTP and HTTPS traffic to services within the cluster. 

Load Balancing::
Ingress Controllers, such as NGINX or HAProxy, handle the actual routing and load balancing of traffic based on the defined rules. 

SSL Termination::
Ingress Controllers can handle SSL termination, decrypting incoming SSL/TLS traffic before passing it to the backend services. 

Multiple Domains and Paths::
Ingress supports routing traffic for multiple domains and paths, making it suitable for complex web applications.
