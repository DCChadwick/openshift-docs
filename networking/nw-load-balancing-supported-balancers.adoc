= Load Balancers Supported in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform {product-title}

{product-title} supports the following load balancers:

*Elastic load balancer (ELB): ELB is a balancing service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses. 
*Classic Load Balancer (CLB): CLB is the default load balancer for self-managed AWS OCP clusters (self-managed). If no value is specified, the installation program defaults to Classic. For more information, see [Installation configuration parameters for AWS](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.16/installing/installing_aws/installation-config-parameters-aws.html).
*Network Load Balancer (NLB): NLB is the default load balancer for ROSA. For more information, see 
Application Load Balancer (ALB): ALBs are intended to be used directly in front of an application, not in front of the router. ALBs require the AWS Load Balancer Operator add-on, which is not supported for all AWS regions and OCP profiles. Refer to the AWS Load Balancer Operator documentation for more details.
