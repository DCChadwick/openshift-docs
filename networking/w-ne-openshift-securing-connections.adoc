= Securing connections
Ingress Controllers often handle SSL termination, which decrypts incoming SSL/TLS traffic before passing it to the backend services. This offloads the encryption/decryption process from the application pods. Use TLS certificates to encrypt traffic between clients and your Kubernetes services. You can manage certificates with tools like cert-manager to automate the issuance and renewal of certificates.

Network policies allow you to define rules for how pods can communicate with each other and other network endpoints. This enhances security by controlling traffic flow within the cluster. These policies are implemented at the network plugin level, ensuring that only allowed traffic can flow between pods.

Kubernetes uses Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage permissions and control who can access and perform actions on resources within the cluster. Service accounts provide identity for pods that access the Kubernetes API, allowing for granular control over what each pod can do.
