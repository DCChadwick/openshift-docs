= Example: Configuring pod-to-pod communication

Imagine you have a microservices-based application with multiple pods such as a front-end pod and a back-end pod. The front-end pod needs to communicate with the back-end pod to retrieve data. By using pod-to-pod communication, either directly or through services, these pods can efficiently exchange information.

To control and secure pod-to-pod communication, Kubernetes allows you to define Network Policies. These policies specify how pods can interact with each other based on labels and selectors. This helps in enforcing security and compliance requirements.

   [source, yaml]
   apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
   kind: NetworkPolicy
   metadata:
     name: allow-some-pods
     namespace: default
   spec:
     podSelector:
       matchLabels:
         role: app
     ingress:
       - from:
           - podSelector:
               matchLabels:
                 role: backend
         ports:
           - protocol: TCP
             port: 80
