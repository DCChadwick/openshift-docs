= Key networking concepts and components

Key concepts in OpenShift networking include:

Pods and Services::
Pods are the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes, and services provide stable IP addresses and DNS names for sets of pods. Each pod in a Kubernetes cluster is assigned a unique IP address. Pods can communicate with each other directly using their IP addresses, regardless of which node they are on.

Ingress and Routes::
Ingress resources define rules for routing external HTTP and HTTPS traffic to services within the cluster. Routes are used to expose services to external traffic. Ingress Controllers, such as NGINX or HAProxy, manage the actual routing based on these rules.

Container Network Interface (CNI)::
The CNI plugin manages the pod network, enabling pod-to-pod communication.

Cluster Network Operator (CNO)::
The CNO plugin manage cluster network configuration, including pod network CIDR and service network CIDR.

DNS Operator::
DNS operators manage DNS services within the cluster, ensuring services are reachable by their DNS names.

Network Policies::
Network policies define how pods are allowed to communicate with each other and with other network endpoints. These policies help secure the cluster by controlling traffic flow and enforcing rules for pod communication.

Load Balancing::
Load balancing distributes network traffic across multiple servers to ensure reliability and performance.

Service Discovery::
Service discovery is a mechanism for services to find and communicate with each other within the cluster.

Kube-Proxy::
Kube-Proxy is a network proxy that runs on each node and ensures that network traffic is correctly routed to the appropriate pods.

OpenShift Container Platform Ingress Operator::
The Ingress Operator implements the IngressController API, enabling external access to cluster services by deploying and managing HAProxy-based Ingress Controllers. This allows for routing traffic using OpenShift Route and Kubernetes Ingress resources.
