= Security and traffic management
Administrators can expose applications to external traffic and secure network connections using service types like node ports and load balancers, and API resources like Ingress and Route. The Ingress Operator and Cluster Network Operator play crucial roles in configuring and managing these aspects. An Ingress Operator deploys and manages one or more Ingress Controllers, which are responsible for routing external HTTP and HTTPS traffic to services within the cluster. A cluster network operator deploys and manages the cluster network components (such as pod networks, service networks, DNS, etc.)

Cluster administrators have several options for exposing applications to external traffic and securing network connections, such as service types (node ports and load balancers) and API resources (Ingress and Route).
