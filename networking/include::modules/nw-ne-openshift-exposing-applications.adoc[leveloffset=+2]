In Kubernetes, ClusterIP is the default service type. It exposes the service on an internal IP within the cluster, making it accessible only to other services within the cluster. The NodePort service type exposes the service on a static port on each node's IP, which allows external traffic to access the service. LoadBalancer service is typically used in cloud environments. This service type provisions an external load balancer that routes external traffic to the service.

An API object that manages external access to services, usually HTTP and HTTPS. It provides load balancing, SSL termination, and name-based virtual hosting. A controller that implements the Ingress API, such as NGINX or HAProxy, to handle the actual routing of traffic based on defined rules.
