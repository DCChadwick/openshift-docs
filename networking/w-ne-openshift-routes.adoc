= What are routes?

Routes are OpenShift-specific resources that expose a service at a host name, such as `www.example.com`, so that external clients can reach it by name. Here are some key points about Routes:
* Host Name Mapping::
Routes map a host name to a service, allowing external clients to access the service using the host name. 

* Load Balancing::
OpenShift routers provide load balancing for the traffic directed to the service. 

*DNS Resolution::
The host name used in a route is resolved to the IP address of the router, which then forwards the traffic to the appropriate service. 
Security: Routes can be secured using TLS/SSL to encrypt the traffic between the client and the service.
