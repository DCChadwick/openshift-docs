= What is a cluster?

A cluster in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (and Kubernetes in general) is a collection of nodes (which are virtual or physical machines) that work together to run containerized applications. These nodes include master nodes and worker nodes. Master nodes manage the cluster, maintaining the desired state and handling cluster-wide operations. Worker nodes run the containers (pods) that house the application workloads. Together, these nodes form a cohesive environment where resources can be efficiently managed, scaled, and distributed to meet the needs of the applications running within the cluster.
