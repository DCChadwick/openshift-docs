By default, the router uses a dynamic configuration manager to propagate endpoint changes using dynamic HAPRoxy API. This approach allows the router to adapt to changes efficiently reducing the number of reloads needed and hence the memory footprint. The dynamic configuration manager uses the HAProxy dynamic API to modify the operational state of HAProxy backends. Endpoint changes, such as scaling up and down, are managed by provisioning each backend with a pool of dynamic servers.
