= Key DNS terms

CoreDNS::
CoreDNS is the default DNS server for Kubernetes. It provides name resolution for Kubernetes services and pods. When a new service is created, CoreDNS automatically updates its records.
  
DNS Names::
Services are assigned DNS names based on their namespace and name. For example, a service named `my-service` in the `default` namespace would have the DNS name `my-service.default.svc.cluster.local`.

Domain Names::
These are the human-friendly names that we use to access websites and services, such as example.com.

IP Addresses::
These are numerical labels assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. An example of an IP address is 192.0.2.1.

DNS Servers::
These are specialized servers that store DNS records, which map domain names to IP addresses. When you type a domain name into your browser, your computer contacts a DNS server to find the corresponding IP address.

Resolution Process::
When you enter a domain name in your browser, a DNS query is sent to a DNS resolver, which then contacts a series of DNS servers to find the IP address associated with the domain name. Once the IP address is found, it is returned to your browser, which then connects to the web server using the IP address.
