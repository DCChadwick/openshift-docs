= Pod-to-pod communication

Pod-to-pod communication in Kubernetes refers to the ability of pods to communicate with each other within the cluster. This is crucial for the functioning of microservices and distributed applications. 

Each pod in a Kubernetes cluster is assigned a unique IP address. Pods can communicate directly with each other using their IP addresses. This is useful for intra-cluster communication where pods need to exchange data or perform tasks collaboratively. For example, Pod A can send requests directly to Pod B using Pod B's IP address. Kubernetes creates a flat network, meaning all pods can communicate with each other without Network Address Translation (NAT), regardless of where they are scheduled. This allows for seamless communication between pods across different nodes.
